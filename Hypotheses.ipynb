    "Our project is aimed towards the editorial team at Pitchfork. We examine reviews from January 1999 to January 2017 to determine whether ratings are statistically different within different categories - more specifically, we will examine differences in review scores between music genres, between record labels and between music labeled \"Best New Music,\" plus we will try to use Document Classification with Naive Bayes to predict scores based on review content. Our goal is to provide insight on possible biases within their reviews."

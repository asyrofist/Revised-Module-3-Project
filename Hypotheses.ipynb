    "Our project is aimed towards the editorial team at Pitchfork. We examine reviews from January 1999 to January 2017 to determine whether ratings are statistically different within different categories - more specifically, we will examine differences in review scores between music genres, between record labels, between music labelled \"Best New Music\" and between reviewers. Our goal is to provide insight on possible biases within their reviews."

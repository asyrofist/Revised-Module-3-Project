# Pitchfork Reviews Hypothesis Testing Analysis

## Introduction

The project

## Installation

In order to get the Jupyter notebooks to work, you will have to download the
Pitchfork Reviews Sqlite Database first [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data)

Make sure you place the unzipped file under the project root folder and name it
`database.sqlite`

## How-To

Once you have setup the Pitchfork database, you are good to go through each of
the questions we tried to answer during our project. Those questions are detailed
in a distinct Jupyter Notebook inside the project :

- Question1 - Bias by Genre
- Question2_Label
- Question3 - Score Threshold
- Question4_Reviewers

An extra python file named 'DocumentClassification.py' contains our Naive Bayes
Document Classification python class used in Question 4.

Have a good read and hope you will enjoy our analysis
